I’m afraid I have some bad news for my fellow data scientists; data science is one of the worst investments a company can make today.

While individual projects can do 1000x returns on investment, the chances of your companies next project doing that are next to none, and in fact the chances of it failing completely are quite high. Last year Gartner estimated that as many as 85% of data initiatives fail.

For the lucky folks far away from corporate boardrooms, it may be hard to imagine convincing executives at a fortune 500 company to give you 10–100 million toward some project with only a 15% chance of success, but it happens all the time.

Some would say it’s time to call it quits, hang up our neural nets and retire our GPU’s and go back to the physics labs or math buildings we came from.

Me, I’m not so sure. The problem isn’t that data science is a sham, its that data science is inherently risky. When working on really cutting edge problems it’s just hard to say at the start of a project whether it will work out or not.

The good news is someone has already figured out how to solve this problem, enter startups.

> “A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” — Eric Reis The Lean Startup

If that isn’t your average data science project I don’t know what is. The implications of approaching data science from an entrepreneurial path are immediate and far reaching. To keep this read under five minutes, I’ll briefly highlight three big takeaways.

# 1. Build the Minimum Viable Model

>“If You’re Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You’ve Launched Too Late” — Reid Hoffman cofounder LinkedIn

Hoffman’s comments transfer perfectly to models.

*The first model should be terrible, consider it a Minimum Viable Model.*

The reality is unfortunately, quite often the opposite. Data science projects are often black holes into which money is poured, one day a pristine model emerges with nice scores and beautiful underlying data. The team is always shocked to discover the model isn’t solving the customer’s real problem.

And that’s exactly the issue, data science for all it’s talk of experimentation and science might be the least agile branch of software.

Instead of treating data science projects as Ph.D dissertations, they need to be treated as what they are, entrepreneurial software projects. Build an MVM, get it in front of users and keep iterating on it.

# 2. Mitigate Risk with Funding Rounds

The genius of the startup funding model is simple.

*Risk mitigation through repeated project valuation.*

Data science projects are notoriously difficult to evaluate, part of the reason for this is they often promise something so brilliantly innovative that it has literally never been done before. Funding projects like this is no different than funding a startup claiming some industry changing technology.

It’s worth noting the most damaging kind of failure is not a proposed project failing to be funded, it’s a fully funded project spending it’s full budget, delivering a non operational model, and learning nothing meaningful in the process. This means within the entrepreneurial mindset risk is reduced not by getting closer to completion but by reducing the uncertainty around the validity of the proposed solution. One might then give a tongue in cheek description of entrepreneurship as search for local minima of work required to reduce a systems entropy by some factor.

A project repeatedly shows how it has reduced risk by proving or disproving validity, and receives funding based on how this proof shows greater expected value for the project. If the project begins to stutter consider pivoting, maybe this project won’t solve the problem it set out to solve, but is an ideal solution for something else.

# 3. Achieve Growth through Competition

Most data science organizations claim to be flat but are extremely hierarchical. Money and project ideas flow down from the top, rather than organically emerging from whatever minds devise them.

*Data science is evolving too fast for top down organizations to keep up.*

Enabling an open environment where projects can originate at any layer of seniority is the only way an organization can hope to keep up with the dizzying pace of the field. Inter-organizational competition needs to be seen not as a threat, but as a necessary fitness function which allows the best ideas rise to the top.

>“The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.” — George. S. Patton

While not a traditional startup leader General Patton’s ideas on competition certainly ring true in the competitive space of data science. The reality is that regardless of whether an organization stifles competition or accepts it, the second it’s products leave it’s premises competition is a very real thing.

# Summary

Data science has produced some of the greatest tech innovations in the past decade, but as practiced in many organizations it’s also completely unsustainable. Producing more relevant models, mitigating risk and keeping up with the pace of the field will require organizations to rethink how they do data science. Structuring data science as entrepreneurship makes it a great investment once again.
