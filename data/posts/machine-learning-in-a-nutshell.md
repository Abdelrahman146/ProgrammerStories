## Introduction
Machine Learning is the key behind numerous number of modern technologies. Artificial Intelligence, Business Intelligence, Internet of Things and Languages Processing are all part of this unique programming mechanism that made our world smarter and robotic.

## What is Machine Learning ?
Machine learning is simply a group of programming algorithms that makes the software take decisions and make predictions hard coding. It's in a way inspired from how the human brain learns.

#### How Does the human Brain learns ?
We learn from experience. Let's take a simple example, a small newborn child sees a cat for the first time, she opened her eyes astonished!  the mother says “this is a cat sweetie!”. The brain of the child will observe the cat and see all of its features, and save it in her memory. Next time if an animal passed by, the child will immediately compare it to what it has in her memory. If they are similar then its a cat. However, we all know sometimes the child will not predict right because she only saw one cat in her life. But the more experience she has and the more cats she observes the more accurate she will be in her decisions.

#### Machine Learning: Simulating our Brain
In a similar behavior to our brain, we somehow show the machine or the software a *picture* of a cat and instruct it “this is how cats look like”. The software will *observe* and learn, and make *decisions* based on the picture given. The more cats picture we give the machine the more accurate it will be in making decisions.

Ver simple right ? however, it is more complicated in real life, the picture of the cat is not only a simple a picture. It is large table composed of rows and columns filled with so many data.  When The software observes the data it will be analyzed, filtered, and cleaned to go to the learning phase which is when software gets trained based on the data given. And then after the training it will be able to make decisions on its own with a percentage of accuracy.

## Machine Learning Vs. Hard Coding
You might be a bit confused “but hey, we can do the same thing in basic programming ,how machine learning is different? “. in basic programming, you make a code full of logical operations with nested if statements and loops. For example, the algorithm of your code might be like “ if it walks on 4 legs with a tail, 2 eyes and 2 ears then its a cat “, however, this could be very complicated and time consuming. Also if there is something need to be edited it will be a headache.
In machine learning we simply make an algorithm that takes data and let it create the decision formula or decision tree on its own. We just have to provide it with data or “past experience”.

## Conclusion
In this post we have simplified what is machine learning, and how it got inspired from the learning techniques in the human brain. And we also went through how machine learning is much better than explicit programming because it is very flexible and only dependent on the given data (dependent on what it observes).
